C++ Class to Wrap `librtlsdr` Library

This C++ class provides a high-level interface for interacting with RTL-SDR devices using the `librtlsdr` library. It wraps the common functions of the RTL-SDR device, such as opening and closing the device, setting frequency, sample rate, and gain, as well as reading data from the device.

Features:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The class is initialized with an optional device index (default is 0, for the first device).
   
2. **Opening/Closing Device**:
   - `open()` opens the RTL-SDR device using `rtlsdr_open()`.
   - `close()` ensures the device is closed properly using `rtlsdr_close()`.

3. **Frequency and Sample Rate**:
   - `setFrequency()` sets the device's center frequency in Hz using `rtlsdr_set_center_freq()`.
   - `setSampleRate()` sets the device's sample rate in Hz using `rtlsdr_set_sample_rate()`.

4. **Gain Control**:
   - `setGainMode()` toggles between automatic and manual gain modes.
   - `setGain()` sets the manual gain in dB.

5. **Reading Samples**:
   - `readSamples()` reads raw IQ samples from the device and stores them in a `std::vector<uint8_t>`. It returns the number of bytes read.

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - The class throws `std::runtime_error` exceptions for any errors encountered, which makes it easier to handle errors in higher-level application code.

### How to Compile:
To compile this C++ program, you need to link against the `librtlsdr` library. Here's how you might compile the program using `g++`:

```bash
g++ -o rtl_sdr_test rtl_sdr_test.cpp -lrtlssdr -std=c++11
```

Dependencies:
Make sure you have `librtlsdr` installed on your system. On Linux, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev
```

This class should serve as a robust foundation for integrating RTL-SDR functionality into your C++ projects. Let me know if you need additional functionality or any improvements!
