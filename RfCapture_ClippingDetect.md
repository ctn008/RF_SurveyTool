# How to detect Clipping in RfCapture ?

## 1. Problem statement  
Can call functions in librtlsdr library to set rf_gain and mixer_gain. There is some delay, but generally it works. Also, some rtlsdr progams demonstrate manual gain control capability.

Issue is how to detect signal clipping to control/adjust gain ?

## 2. rf_sample_signal for testing  
Need to have sample signal for testing purpose. Ideally the signal should simulate multiple tetra channels.
This rf_sample_signal will also be used to compare / evaluate whether the gain control functions operate correctly or not...

### 2.1 How to generate rf_sample baseband signal ?  
1. Using s36kIQ signal of real tetra signal, or generate s36kIQ from predefined random inputs ?
2. Multiple tetra signals to be mixed onto the baseband signal
3. different signals (channels) should have different signal power level, and distributed across the baseband.
4. using pluto Tx to transmit via rf cable to rtlsdr receiver - hopefully the signal is large enough to receive and cause clipping. So that we can observe how clipping occurs and how to detect clipping...
5. Signal should be repeated to generate periodic signal.

Should use GR flowgraph to generate the signal and test ?

ok, can generate rf baseband signal (2,56Mhz) for several tetra channels at different signal power levels.

## 3. Techniques to Detect Signal Clipping (from GPT)  
Signal clipping occurs when a signal exceeds its allowable amplitude range, leading to distortion. Here are the key techniques for detecting signal clipping:

## 3.1. Threshold-Based Detection
- Description: Directly checks if the signal amplitude exceeds a predefined maximum or minimum threshold.
- Implementation: Compare each sample against the thresholds T_max and T_min.
- Pros: Simple and effective for hard clipping.
- Cons: Ineffective for soft clipping or signals without clear thresholds.

## 3.2. Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)
- Description: Measures how often the signal crosses the zero amplitude line.
- Indicator: Clipping can alter ZCR, especially in complex or asymmetrically clipped signals.
- Pros: Easy to compute and works in real-time.
- Cons: Insensitive to symmetric hard clipping in simple signals like sine waves.

## 3.3. Spectral Analysis
- Description: Analyzes the frequency spectrum for harmonic distortion introduced by clipping.
- Indicator: Clipping introduces higher-order harmonics and spectral broadening.
- Pros: Effective for detecting subtle clipping.
- Cons: Computationally intensive; requires frequency-domain processing.

## 3.4. Amplitude Histogram Analysis
- Description: Examines the distribution of signal amplitudes.
- Indicator: A clipped signal shows sharp peaks at the clipping thresholds.
- Pros: Visual and intuitive.
- Cons: Requires a sufficient number of samples for reliable analysis.

## 3.5. Dynamic Range Analysis
- Description: Measures the reduction in the dynamic range of the signal.
- Indicator: A clipped signal has a lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).
- Pros: Quantitative and easy to interpret.
- Cons: Less sensitive to mild clipping.

## 3.6. Statistical Analysis
- Description: Uses statistical measures like skewness and kurtosis to detect clipping.
- Indicator:
  - Skewness: Asymmetry due to clipping on one side.
  - Kurtosis: High kurtosis indicates flattened peaks.
- Pros: Works for soft clipping.
- Cons: Requires careful interpretation.

## 3.7. Machine Learning-Based Detection
- Description: Employs machine learning models trained on features extracted from clipped and unclipped signals.
- Features: Time-domain (e.g., ZCR), frequency-domain (e.g., harmonics), and statistical measures.
- Pros: Highly accurate and adaptable.
- Cons: Requires training data and higher computational resources.

## 3.8. Visual Inspection
- Description: Observes the signal waveform for flat regions at amplitude limits.
- Indicator: Flattened peaks and troughs in the time-domain signal.
- Pros: Simple and intuitive.
- Cons: Subjective and impractical for large datasets or real-time monitoring.

## 3.9. Envelope Analysis
- Description: Analyzes the signal envelope for irregularities caused by clipping.
- Indicator: Flattened or distorted envelope peaks.
- Pros: Effective for identifying soft clipping.
- Cons: Requires additional preprocessing.

Choosing the Right Technique:
- Hard Clipping: Threshold detection, amplitude histogram, spectral analysis.
- Soft Clipping: Spectral analysis, statistical methods, envelope analysis.
- Real-Time Applications: ZCR, threshold-based detection.
- Complex Signals: Spectral analysis, machine learning.

For the signal of interests, need to know the signal distribution, and whether it is hard clipping or soft clipping. This can be done by observing the actual signal (simulation).

**Hard Clipping: Threshold detection, amplitude histogram, spectral analysis**  
- Calculate histogram for 16384 bytes of samples (NOTE: take both I&Q samples in the same histogram)
- to determine clipping, need to calculate: current signal level, trend increase of descrease, upper threshold and lower threshold.

- Check clipping: count occurance of (0,1,2,3,4) and (251, 252, 253, 254, 255), if non-zero --> clipping started happening ?
- Smoothing histogram data ? 

**RESULTS**
Using SoapySDR source, with complex bytes output, and push thru histogram block in GR, can see the signal distribution and clearly, the auto agc mode does not work for narrow band signal.

It is clearly shown that we can use threshold detection to detect clipping. Need to implement this function. However, instead of writing c code, would like to write c++ code. Currently testing GPT to generate the code with some limited success.

The above code implements AGC for VGA gain while keeping lna & mixer gain unchanged.
