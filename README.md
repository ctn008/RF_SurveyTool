# Low-Cost RF Survey Tool (RTL-SDR + GPS)

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **low-cost RF survey platform** using multiple **RTL-SDR devices** and a GPS receiver.  
Custom **C++ and Python applications** running on Linux capture, process, and visualize RF coverage data on **Google Maps**, while storing results for post-analysis.

## Additional Notes on RF Survey Tool 

To perform rf survey for tetra radio systems operating in 380-430MHz band with 25KHz channel spacing using RtlSdr devices.
- Obtain RF signal strengths for all Tetra channels in the selected band
- Display rf coverage (signal strength) map for each site and all sites
- Various analysis tasks for rf optimization

### High level software module design
1. RfCapture
- Capture rf signal of all channels & gps location and store to file for offline processing
- Make sure the rf signal is captured at the optimized value (highest gain with no clipping)
2. RfCompute
3. RfAnalyze
4. RfReport
